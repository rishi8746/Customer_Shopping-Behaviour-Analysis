# **Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis**

## **1. Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behaviour using transactional data from across multiple product categories. The primary objective is to uncover insights related to customer spending patterns, segmentation, product preferences and subscription behaviour. These insights are intended to support strategic decision making aimed at improving customer engagement, optimizing marketing efforts and increasing overall revenue.

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis using Python**

Data preparation and exploratory analysis were conducted using Python to ensure data quality and readiness for advanced analysis.

### **Key Steps**

* **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using the `pandas` library.
* **Initial Exploration:** Used `df.info()` to examine data structure and `df.describe()` to understand summary statistics.
* **Missing Data Handling:** Identified missing values and imputed the *Review Rating* column using the **median rating within each product category** to preserve category-level integrity.
* **Column Standardization:** Renamed all columns to **snake_case** for consistency and readability.
* **Feature Engineering:**

  * Created an `age_group` column by binning customer ages into meaningful segments.
  * Derived a `purchase_frequency_days` feature based on purchase behavior.
* **Data Consistency Checks:** Analyzed overlap between `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used` variables and removed `promo_code_used` due to redundancy.
* **Database Integration:** Connected the Python workflow to **PostgreSQL** and loaded the cleaned dataset into the database for SQL-based analysis.

## **4. Data Analysis using SQL (Business Transactions)**

Using PostgreSQL, structured queries were executed to answer key business questions and simulate real-world transactional analysis:

1. **Revenue by Gender:** Compared total revenue generated by male and female customers.
2. **High-Spending Discount Users:** Identified customers who used discounts but still spent above the average purchase amount.
3. **Top 5 Products by Rating:** Ranked products based on highest average review ratings.
4. **Shipping Type Comparison:** Compared average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping options.
5. **Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers:** Evaluated differences in average spend and total revenue by subscription status.
6. **Discount-Dependent Products:** Identified the top five products with the highest percentage of discounted purchases.
7. **Customer Segmentation:** Categorized customers into **New**, **Returning**, and **Loyal** segments based on purchase history.
8. **Top 3 Products per Category:** Determined the most purchased products within each product category.
9. **Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions:** Analyzed whether customers with more than five purchases are more likely to subscribe.
10. **Revenue by Age Group:** Calculated total revenue contribution across different age segments.

## **5. Power BI Dashboard**

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed to visually present key findings and trends. The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore customer segments, revenue drivers, product performance and behavioral patterns through dynamic filters and visuals supporting data-driven decision-making.

## **6. Business Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, the following strategic recommendations are proposed:

* **Boost Subscriptions:** Promote exclusive offers and benefits to convert high-frequency customers into subscribers.
* **Customer Loyalty Programs:** Introduce reward-based initiatives to encourage repeat purchases and move customers into the “Loyal” segment.
* **Review Discount Strategy:** Optimize discount usage to balance sales growth with profit margins.
* **Product Positioning:** Highlight top-rated and best-selling products in marketing campaigns and homepage placements.
* **Targeted Marketing:** Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue age groups and customers who prefer express shipping for faster conversions.
